# “Semantic HTML” 
** refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content—not its appearance. We’ve already been writing semantic HTML (e.g., using <strong> instead of <b>), but there’s a whole set of elements designed for the sole purpose of adding more meaning to the overall layout of a web page. They’re called “sectioning elements”, and they look something like this:
    Using these as an alternative to <div> elements is an important aspect of modern web development because it makes it easier for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website.
