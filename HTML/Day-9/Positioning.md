# Advance Positioning.
** “Static positioning” refers to the normal flow of the page that we’ve been working with up ’til this point. other three types of positioning are “relative”, “absolute”, and “fixed”. Each of them let you manually position elements using specific coordinates.
**vast majority of elements on a web page should be laid out according to the static flow of the page.
**Positioning schemes come into play when things like tweak the position of a particular element or animate a UI component without messing up the surrounding elements.
** Starting by examining relative, absolute, and fixed positioning in isolation, then we’ll apply everything we learned to a fancy dropdown menu.
** “Relative positioning” moves elements around relative to where they would normally appear in the static flow of the page. This is useful for nudging boxes around when the default flow is just a little bit off.
** “Absolute positioning” is just like relative positioning, but the offset is relative to the entire browser window instead of the original position.
** there’s no longer any relationship with the static flow of the page, consider this the most manual way to lay out an element.
