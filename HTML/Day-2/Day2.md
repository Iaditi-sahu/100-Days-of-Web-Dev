# Basic Web Pages
HTML defines every content by "marking-up" the raw content. Every thing in HTML happens between closing and opening brackets(except some).
Every main content of information is written in <body> tag. <body> contents <p> <h1>--<h6>. while title of website is written in <title> tag.
while in <head> section there is mainly css link, page title and other data.
Un-order list provides you with bullets to items rather than numbering.  <!--strictly defined in html that <li> must be inside <ul>or<ol>.
order list is just like its names suggest provides proper numbering. <!--strictly defined in html that <li> must be inside <ul>or<ol>.
Inline Elements --> basically those which effects small word in sentence and make changes in it.
block elements --> which effects the block of code and transform it.
<br> tag as mention above have no closing tag. <em> is same emphasis some text <strong> <italic> etc.
