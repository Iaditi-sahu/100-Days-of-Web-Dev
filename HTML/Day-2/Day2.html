    <h1>Internet is Eassy</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
        headings.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>This is how un-order list is made.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>hey don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <hr/>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
            an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em> you have to draw attention to some phase</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
